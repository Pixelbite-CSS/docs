### Other classes
To use **PixelbiteCSS** as intended, you'll need first to know how it work (_please refer to [this section](https://pixelbite-css.github.io/docs/1_2_How_it_works.html)_).

**PixelbiteCSS** is still in a huge envolment and we still are continuing to let it grow.
- _It's possible that this section will not be updated properly. Keep this in mind._

#### Classes
Classes are devided into two sections:

- ~Non-customizable~
- ~Customizable~

#### Non-Customizable classes
This group is used for classes or HTML elements that cannot be easy to change or are hardly programmed into the _CSS code_.

_We are still working on **custom configs/themes**. These will soon allow users to put their own code to **components** and **classes**._

#### Customizable classes
This group is for classes that are allowed to split with custom properties, like _background (`bg`)_, _border (`b`)_ and more.
